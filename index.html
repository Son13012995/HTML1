        You were only 17
        Lookin' at your window screen
        Sweetest girl I've ever seen
        Straight up from a project dream
        You were on the second floor
        I was right across from yours
        Two different sides of war
        Kinda like a west side story, now

        Leyla, I am in love with you, Leyla
        I'm comin' up any day now
        So bust that window and come with me
        Leyla, get all your stuff and we'll break out
        Baby, I know what they'll say now
        But I want you anyway
        But I want you anyway
        But I want you anyway

        Now we've turned 23
        You've moved across town from me
        Our friends and family, wouldn't let us be happy
        I hear you're married now
        Hear it ain't working out
        They can't shut us down
        Leyla just tell me how and I'll be there
        You are a goddess, I want you to know (oh-oh-oh-oh)
        I'll never forget you, I'll never let go
        Yeah, I'll be comin' to get you

        Leyla, I am in love with you, Leyla
        I'm comin' up any day now
        So bust that window and come with me
        Leyla, get all your stuff and we'll break out
        Baby, I know what they'll say now
        But I want you anyway
        But I want you anyway
        But I want you anyway
        You are a goddess, I want you to know (oh-oh-oh-oh)
        I'll never forget you, I'll never let go
        Yeah, I'll be comin' to get you
        Leyla, I am in love with you, Leyla
        I'm comin' up any day now
        So bust that window and come with me
        Leyla, get all your stuff and we'll break out
        Baby, I know what they'll say now
        But I want you anyway
        But I want you anyway

        Leyla, I am in love with you, Leyla
        I'm comin' up any day now
        So bust that window and come with me
        Leyla, get all your stuff and we'll break out
        Baby, I know what they'll say now
        But I want you anyway
